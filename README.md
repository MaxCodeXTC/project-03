# project-03

A project by Ania Kubów,
Chris Beaney,
Zeeshan Goburdhun,
Camila Buenaventura Márquez

This was a group project but by 4 developers in one week. The app involved building a website using React primarily for the frontend,  Express for the backed, and utilised two API’s (one of them being a geolocation mapping provider).  My role in the group project primarily involved implementing the two API’s, testing routes, building the ‘nominate new’ route, as well as the overall visual layout of the app itself.
