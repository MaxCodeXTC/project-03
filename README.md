# **Project-03: BurgerRator App**

A project by Ania Kubów,
Chris Beaney,
Zeeshan Goburdhun,
Camila Buenaventura Márquez

## Overview

This was a group project but by 4 developers in one week. The app involved building a website using React primarily for the frontend,  Express for the backed, and utilised two API’s (one of them being a geolocation mapping provider).  My role in the group project primarily involved implementing the two API’s, testing routes, building the ‘nominate new’ route, as well as the overall visual layout of the app itself.

## Brief

* Deploy your game online with Heroku, where the rest of the world can access it.

### Approach Taken

First we set up GitHub for the project and assigned a GitHub Master. This was the first time I worked in a group this big so understanding the development branch and the master branch was important to us as a group. We did the first few merges as a team.

We also decided how to write our models for the burgers and Comments together so that everyone was onboard with the structure. Data collection for the burgers was also done together.

We then split out building a component each. We did this so that we would get to built the front end of the component, backend of the component, and test the component. We felt this apporach woudl give us a much more well rounded learning experience. 

We used dotenv to ensure our API keys was safe.


## Wins and Blockers

### Wins
We worked together as a team very well. There was no friction or arguments on the one week project. I feel this was because we white boarded out the solution as a team, used trello effectively for project management, and used GitHub correctly for merges.

### Blockers
There weren't any major blockers. We finished the project ahead of our expected time and even managed to start on some 'nice to have' features. This included adding the Beer Matcher API to go with your burger.
